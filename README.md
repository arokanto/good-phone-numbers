Good Phone Numbers
==================

A simple JavaScript program to sort a bunch of phone numbers, based on how "good" they are. Numbers are scored based on three criteria:
- The amount of occurences of a single digit within the number
- The amount of adjacent digits within a number (up to a set maximum)
- The existence of patterns within the number

Check `example.html` for an example on how to use it.
